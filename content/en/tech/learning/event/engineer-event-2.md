## About this article

Yesterday, I summarized the advantages and disadvantages of study groups.
Today I would like to summarize the types of study groups.

### Who wrote this article?

23-year-old engineer in his first year of engineering.

I want to learn more on weekends, so I've been attending study groups twice a week for the past two months.

## Study sessions I've attended

- LT
- Reading session
- Presentations
- Conferences

## LT

A lightning talk is a talk in which the speaker summarizes his or her interests and experiences in about five minutes.

You can learn more about the topic in a short time because you can hear only the main points in a short time.

In the LT I attended, the main points were summarized very well, and I felt it was very time efficient.

## Reading session

Each participant brings a technical book and introduces what they learned from the book and its contents to each other.

It's similar to a bibliobattle, since there are books other than IT books, such as novels, business books, etc., that are not restricted to books.

I like to read, so I was able to encounter a variety of books and had a good time.

I recommend this study group to those who want to have a wide range of knowledge.

## Presentation

Just like a lecture, there is a speaker, and the speaker and listener are clearly defined.

This is recommended for those who want to sit back and learn the ideas and techniques of the speakers.

In general, the lecture proceeds according to the slides, so it is easy to grasp the flow of the talk.

I felt that a lot depended on the skill of the lecturer.

## Conference

I attended the PHP Conference 2017, and there were a lot of people there.

There were a lot of booths of companies, and representatives and CTOs of each company.

I would recommend this event to anyone who wants to actually talk to people from companies or talk to a lot of engineers.

## How to find a study group

I often search for study sessions on [skill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.ysinc.skill&hl=ja) and [connpss](https://connpass.com).

You can search by criteria or by category. Please try it out.

## Criteria for choosing a study session

I check for presentations by companies that I am interested in or that I use in my work, and try to go if the schedule fits.

## Summary

It's been about two months since I started attending study groups after work and on weekends, which I thought would be better than spending my weekends slacking off.

I have also been able to gain knowledge in fields I didn't know before because I have found engineers who share information with me.

I will continue to attend workshops in fields that interest me while setting aside time to work on my own projects.

Thank you very much for reading this article.
