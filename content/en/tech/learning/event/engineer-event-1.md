## The author of this article

23 years old, first year engineer.
I want to learn more on Saturdays and Sundays, so I've been attending study groups about twice a week for the past two months.

## Main contents of this article

- Advantages of participating in study sessions
- Demerits I felt from the study sessions
- What did I learn by participating in the study group?
- Summary

## Advantages I felt from participating in the study sessions

1. I was able to deepen my knowledge and learn things that I wouldn't normally know.
I was able to find out what technologies other companies are using now. 3.
3. meet other engineers.

### I was able to deepen my knowledge and learn things that I don't normally know.

In addition to deepening my knowledge of the technologies that I use in my daily work, I was able to take a step further in learning about technologies that I was interested in but had never touched before by participating in a workshop.

**The ability to ask questions directly to the presenters is also a big advantage! **I think one of the biggest advantages is that you can ask questions directly to the presenter!
I also appreciate the fact that many of the materials are prepared so that I can read and review them later.

### 2. I was able to learn what other companies are using now.

There were times when I attended a study session where a representative from a company gave a presentation, and it was very interesting to hear about the technologies used in services and games.

There are times when I decide to attend a study session based on the service rather than the technology.

It was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the company.

### 3. Meet other engineers

**I personally think this is the best benefit** of participating in a study group.

Most of the study sessions have a time for discussion, so you can talk with engineers who have more experience than you, which can be helpful for your own career planning.

In addition, since the study sessions themselves are often held after work or on holidays, I felt that many of the participants were engineers** who were particularly motivated to learn, since they took time out of their personal time to attend.
So when you meet people who are working harder than you, your motivation will increase and you can hear about their own study methods.

## Disadvantages of study groups

1. You are restricted to a certain amount of time.
2. Learning speed is constant.
Learning costs are high.

## Disadvantages of study groups

Of course, you need to travel to attend a study session.

In order to participate in a study session, you need to travel and wait for a while.

### 2. Learning speed is constant

In study groups, the pace of learning is influenced by the whole group, which is good when you don't know what you're learning, but when you join a group with the intention of reviewing, you may have too much time on your hands.

Given that you can also learn on the Internet, I felt that some people would be able to learn more if they studied privately at home instead of in a study group.
Of course, there are times when it's nice to be able to ask questions when you don't understand something.
I personally think that it is more efficient to participate in study groups for technologies that you are interested in or languages that you don't know well yet.

### 3. Cost of participation

Many study groups charge a participation fee.

This is a disadvantage because you can learn for free on the Internet.

What did I learn by participating in the ## study group?

You can change your level of knowledge from "I've heard of it before" to "I know about it".
Deepen my understanding of technology.
To expand the network of engineers.
I can actually meet and talk with engineers and hear examples of how they are actually doing things, so I can improve my communication skills.
I can broaden my horizons because there are people from various companies.
Motivation will increase because there are more amazing people than you.

## Summary

I started attending study groups vaguely, thinking "I'd rather learn something than spend my weekends pointlessly," but in the past two months I've met a lot of senior engineers who have given me advice on my career, and I've found study groups to be a good opportunity to learn things I didn't know.
I felt that the study sessions were a good opportunity for me to learn something I didn't know. I personally feel that the study sessions are suitable for me because I can learn easily without feeling like I am studying.

In the future, I would like to post study sessions that I am interested in on Qiita and output my learning.
