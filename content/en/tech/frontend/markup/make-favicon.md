## What is a favicon?

A favicon is an image that appears in the tabs of your browser.
For example, in Google Chrome, the default image is a gray globe logo as shown in the screenshot.

<img width="151" alt="スクリーンショット 2020-06-14 0.37.15.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/199085/fd075f6c-26ee-cd90-130a-4f096c9fd5a3.png">

The image size is `16px x 16px`, which is very fine.

I am going to add this image here.

## Create a favicon.

## First, prepare the original image.
Let's create the original image for the favicon.
This time, we will use canva to create it.

I often use canva because it's a free service that allows you to easily create a variety of images, including banners.

This time I would like to make it with text.

<img width="1386" alt="スクリーンショット 2020-06-14 0.30.17.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/199085/a1bbb271-cd28-6269-7e3c-eace7309f6be.png">

I'm not sure if I have good taste, but it's done.

### Convert the created image to a favicon

Upload the created image to this tool and convert it.

I will be using this favicon creation tool for this conversion.
[Favicon Creation Tool](https://www.websiteplanet.com/ja/webtools/favicon-generator/)

Unzip the downloaded zip file to create a 16x16 size favicon.

## Finished!

It's so tiny!
This kind of reminds me of the emoji from my high school days when I was in Galaga.

This is what it looks like when applied to an actual website.

It's a readable size for up to two characters.

In my case, this is the minimum I needed.

If you can make a logo or a picture, you can try it.

Recently, it has become possible to create favicons in SVG, so I would like to try that next.

Thank you for reading to the end.
