## Convert jpg and png images from personal site to WebP.

Since the site is running on wordpress, I used a batch conversion using a plugin here.

There are two conversion settings: one for images that have been uploaded so far and one for images that will be uploaded in the future.

[Procedures used for reference](https://tekito-style.me/columns/wordpress-image-webp)

I'm using about 1500 images throughout the site.

The current problem is that the display speed on mobile is slow and the mobile abandonment rate is high.

### Images in the site before WebP conversion
