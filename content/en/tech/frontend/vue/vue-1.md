## What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a front-end framework that was created in 2014.

It has the same functionality as React, but with a focus on ease of use and low learning costs.

In addition, there is a large amount of information in the documentation on the official website, so it is possible to catch up by following the steps there.

## Steps to catch up

1. read the official documentation
1. read the book
1. actually touch it
1. create a simple application

### Try reading the official documentation

As mentioned above, Vue.js has an abundance of official documentation, so you can learn a lot just by reading this.

https://jp.vuejs.org

### Try to read a book

Read "Vue.js from the Basics" and try it out.

You can learn the basics of Vue.js, Vuex, etc.

### Actually touch it

I think the best way to learn programming is to make something, so I'm going to make a simple game.

This time, I'm going to make a card game that can be played on a smartphone.

The reason I chose to make a card game is because of the cards (components) and the numerical control (Vuex) of HP, attack power, etc.

The reason why we chose to make a card game is because we thought it would be a good way to experience the various features of Vue.js.

### Try making a simple application

I actually made a card game.

We chose this subject because we wanted to make a game, but I think it was a good assignment to catch up on the basic functions of Vue.js.
