## Background

1. I feel like I'm trying to do something other than Qiita, like a miscellaneous blog.
1. I set up a blog with Gatsby.js, which was recommended by a friend of mine who is an engineer.
1. I'll just do as you say and touch it anyway.

## Base

This time I decided to go with Gatby.js + Netlify.

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/

I cloned and tried several Gatsby starters.
This starter seemed to be the most suitable for use as a blog.

## Reasons for selecting Gatby.js + Netlify

- Gatsby is a static site generator, so it's fast.
- I've never touched React before, so I want to take this opportunity to try it out.
- Netlify is connected to GitHub, so it's easy to grow grass.

## Things to prepare

- Github account
- Domain name to use for the blog

No need to rent a server.

## Procedure

I'm going to do this article as is.

It was easy to build the environment and publish.

## What I liked about it

- Easy to build
- Fast display speed, and the analysis score is quite high even in the initial stage.
- The contact form is provided, so it is easy to set up and implement.

## What I had trouble with

- I'm not familiar with React, so I had to try a lot of things when modifying it.
- Can't show a preview just by putting a link in the post like WordPress
- Can't display images when embedding Instagram.

 **Another thing: I don't have anything to write about (or rather, I have something to write about, but my hand stops thinking I need to write a proper article)**.
I realized that the only way to create an output habit is to keep going.

## Things I fixed

- Introduced GoogleAnalytics
- Compressed and lightened images using an image lightening tool
- Accessibility is not a perfect score by default, so I modified it individually
Changed the design to make it easier to score at that time, etc.
- Minimizing images to focus on performance is not good, so I want to fix it.

## Completed

Now available here.

The performance was great!
