## Try to touch python

What I was worried about/thought about at first

- python seems to be very difficult.
- I think I'm going to get frustrated with the difficult process.
- I'm not good at building environments, so I don't know if I can handle it.
- I want to touch and create AI!

*I started with the idea that I'd give it a try anyway!*

## What we did this time

- Building the environment with docker-toolbox.
- Learn the actual python process.
- I touched the AI application.
- summary

## 1.Building the environment with dockertoolbox

こちらに関しては先出しした[docker-toolbox をmacにインストールするのに色々迷った話](https://qiita.com/ranmaru_genki/items/bbffb904ed223e1bffb5)に書かせて頂きました。
初めてでしたので本の中で紹介されていたdocker-toolboxを使用しました。
次回はdockerで環境構築がしてみたいです。

## 2.Learn actual python processing

I had learned a lot about python beforehand at [progate](https://prog-8.com/).
I'm always indebted to Pro Gate because it's easy to understand (^o^).
This time, I was happy when the process flowed because I did it by myself from the environment construction.

At this stage, we reviewed the if and for statements that we learned in PHP and Javascript.
We also got used to the unique grammar of python.

I'm glad I did, because it helped me lay the groundwork!

### 3.I touched the AI application.

Once you have learned the process, you can try out the AI application provided.
After learning the process to a certain extent, I realized that I wanted to extend and improve it.
I'm currently working on adding more processing to it.

I personally enriched the patterns of my responses and so on.

## summary

Python has been the talk of the town, so I decided to give it a try.
I was worried about learning a new language on my own, but this time I followed the book and used progates, so I was able to proceed on my own.

I think it was also a good experience for me to be able to build the environment, back-end and front-end applications.

I would like to continue to keep my footwork light and try out languages that interest me.

There are many holes in this article, but I would appreciate it if you could look at it with warm eyes.
Thank you for reading this far.
