## The author of this article.

23 years old, first year engineer.

Interested in python and learning it by buying books.

The book I bought and referred to this time: [～short intensive course～ Python programming class that you can learn on weekends](http://www.sbcr.jp/products/4797388978.html?sku=4797388978#supportDl)

## What I was worried about/thought about at first

- I think python is very difficult.
- I think I'm going to get frustrated by the difficult processing.
- I'm not good at building environments...
- I want to touch and create AI!

*Well, I just started with the idea of trying it anyway! *

## What we did this time

- Build an environment with docker-toolbox.
- Learn actual python processing.
- Touching up an AI application.
- Summary

### 1.Building the environment with dockertoolbox

I wrote about this in [The story of how I got lost installing docker-toolbox on my mac](https://qiita.com/ranmaru_genki/items/bbffb904ed223e1bffb5).

Since it was my first time, I used docker-toolbox which was introduced in the book.

Next time, I would like to build an environment with docker.

### 2.Learn actual python processing

I had learned a lot about python from [Progate](https://prog-8.com/) in advance.

I'm always grateful to Progate for their easy-to-understand explanations (^o^).

This time, I was happy when the process flowed because I did everything from building the environment by myself.

At this stage, I'm reviewing the if and for statements that I learned in PHP and Javascript.

I also got used to the unique grammar of python.

I'm glad I did it because it helped me solidify the basics!

### 3.I touched the AI application.

Once you have learned the process, you can try out the AI application provided.

After learning the process to a certain extent, I realized that I wanted to extend and improve it.

I'm currently working on adding more processing to it.

I've personally added a variety of response patterns.

## Summary

Python has been a hot topic in the world, so I tried it this time.

I was worried about learning a new language on my own, but this time I followed the book and used progates, so I was able to proceed on my own.

I think it was also a good experience for me to be able to build the environment, backend, and frontend of the application.

I would like to keep my footwork light and try out languages that interest me in the future.

There are many holes in this article, but I would appreciate it if you could look at it with warm eyes.

Thank you for reading this far.
