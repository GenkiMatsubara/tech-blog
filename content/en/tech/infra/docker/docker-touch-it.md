## How it happened

I'm currently working on a project that involves switching from vagrant to docker.
I'm working on a project where I'm switching from vagrant to docker.
I was able to use docker, but I didn't know how to install it.
Thanks to my senior who took care of everything, I can now use docker, but I still don't know how to install docker...

## Goal for this time

I'm going to drop docker on my own on weekends and try to use the commands I'm not good at.

## What I've tried

I knew I wouldn't be able to figure it out if I tried it right away.
I used other people's articles as a reference.

### Download docker first

Well, first of all, no problem! Drag and drop the familiar Mr. Whale.

https://docs.docker.com/

### Launch the docker you dropped.
- Run the docker you dropped on your PC.
- Enter your password to make changes to your PC.
- The familiar whale symbol is added to the bar.

- docker running is now available! <img width="342" alt="docker2.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/199085/8944c97b-4b78-9ecc-4073-eea7f1381951.png">

To be honest, I wasn't sure if I'd make it this far, so I'm relieved:relaxed:

### What, I don't remember making an ID?

It says below to create an account, yes.

So, create one. <img width="1217" alt="docker4.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/199085/165014f4-26bf-fe8f-6216-7e84bf340ec0.png">

### Create an account
It took me a while to figure out my username, but I was able to create an account and log in.
I received an email when the account was properly created. <img width="535" alt="docker5.png" src="https://qiita-image-store.s3.amazonaws.com/0/199085/9467fb0b-9a20-7268-273f-140243719ad5.png

I've successfully logged in with the account I created!

## Now let's touch it up!

I thought I'd write more about it, but it's a long story, so I'll write more next time.

I heard a lecture about docoker at the PHP Conference 2017 that I attended the other day.
I heard a lecture about docoker at the PHP Conference 2017 that I attended the other day, and it got me interested.
(It's my secret that I didn't understand half of it.

This time, I tried to touch docker!

I'm going to continue to learn from my seniors and read articles for reference.
I'm going to continue to study docker.
