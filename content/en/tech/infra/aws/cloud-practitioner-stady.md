## What's this article about?

This is a record (preparation) of an AWS beginner who is going to take the most beginner level of AWS certification, Cloud Practitioner.

I will mainly write about the process of taking the exam, the exam fee, and what kind of preparation is required.

I want to pass the exam and even write about my success.


## Intended audience for this article

What is AWS certification? What is AWS certification?

People who are thinking of taking the AWS certification

(In other words, people who are at the same level as I am now, who are about to learn)


## Why take the exam?

I decided to take the exam because I was excited to start something in the new year.

I decided to take the exam because I wanted to start something in the new year.

I tried to take the exam on the shortest possible date, but the weekends were already booked in the Tokyo area, so I decided to take it in February.

The study period is about three weeks.

Even if I fail the exam, I'll still have the knowledge I've gained from studying, so I'm entering for now.


## What is an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner?

This is the most basic of the 11 AWS certifications.

It is a certification equivalent to six months of practical experience.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Official Site

Required Skills

A level of knowledge and skills in the AWS Cloud that allows you to effectively explain your overall understanding.


## About the exam

Exam duration is 90 minutes, 65 questions

Four-choice mark-sheet-based exam

Pass with a score of 700 or higher out of 1000 points

The exam fee is 1100 yen, and the mock exam is 2000 yen.

The pass rate and past questions are not published and are not available on the internet, so it is better to take a mock exam.

By the way, if you pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, you will be able to take a mock exam for the next rank of AWS certification for free.


## Preparation to do before the exam day

You can take the exam by selecting a test center from the AWS certification website.

You can take the exam at any time on weekdays, as they are generally filled from weekends.

Prior knowledge of AWS

I have used AWS for about 3 months (EC2 only).

Able to build a simple environment and deploy to a development environment.


## Study for the exam

Official videos and documentation

There is a lot of documentation on this.

I can basically understand most of it by reading the documentation.

The official sample questions are all in English, but the actual exam is in Japanese.

The translated sample foundation questions can be found by googling.


## Books

Buy some books for learning.

I bought the following books.

> AWS Certification Exam Textbook AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 

I chose this textbook because it had the latest publication date among the textbooks in the bookstore.

I chose this textbook because it was the most up-to-date among the textbooks in the bookstore.


## Impressions while studying

There are a lot of things that I need to memorize.

In the early stages of learning, there are many cases where I know what to do in this case, but I can't remember the name of this AWS function.

This problem can be solved gradually by repeating the process and actually moving your hands.

It gives you a chance to touch functions you have never used before.

In practice, I have been doing only deployments, so when there is a problem with a function I don't know, it becomes an opportunity to study it.

I felt it was a good way to learn a wide range of knowledge.


## Lastly

So, I'm going to take the exam next month in February.

I know 3 weeks is a short time to study, but I don't think I'll be able to continue learning if I do it for too longðŸ˜….

I'll try my best to write about my success. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
