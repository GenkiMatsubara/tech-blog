**as of October 25, 2017**.
I've been a windows user until now.
I've been a windows user until now, and I decided to change my PC.

From here on, we will be setting up Sourcetree.
The settings will be different for each individual, so that's all for now.

It didn't take long once I followed the pop-up!

## Summary

This time it was easy because it was only a download.

If I have time, I would like to write about the transfer from windows to Mac.
