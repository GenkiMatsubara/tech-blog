<h2>Good content is not always appreciated</h2>.

<h3>What do you think are the requirements for good content? </H3>

For example, if you generate content with great design and functionality, many users will use it.

Many craftspeople have this idea.

However, no matter how great the content is, that alone will not attract people to your site.

This is because no matter how sophisticated the content is, if people don't know about it, they won't bother to search for it directly.

Therefore, in order to make people aware of the content, it is necessary to make users aware of it through advertising.
This is why companies use advertising to attract users every day.

<h3>This action is marketing. </h3

In today's world, many people use their smartphones to get information.

As a result, many companies are emphasizing the importance of marketing on the Internet.

Just by looking at social networking sites every day, you will see many advertisements, but behind the scenes, the marketers of each company are thinking about and taking various approaches to marketing on a daily basis.

<h2>What is the purpose of advertising</h2>?

The purpose of advertising is to make the user aware of the content.

When a user sees an ad, he or she recognizes the content.

And once they are aware and interested in the content, they will search for it and take action.

When awareness spreads, it becomes a topic of conversation, and relatively speaking, people search the site, follow the SNS, etc., and become fans who support the content for a long time as repeaters.

## Summary

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-575" src="https://genki-techblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ed788d7992b6011391143f7d3a066393-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />

No matter how good the content is, it is useless if it is not needed by the users.
It is important to think about how to create content, but it is also important to think about how to make it known.

The ability to create content and the ability to make people aware of the content are two completely different skills.
They are like the two wheels of a bicycle.
It is impossible to go far on a bicycle with unbalanced wheels.

When you work in a company, you don't have the opportunity to do both because the roles are divided.
I would like to expand my knowledge of both in order to get better results.

<h2>Recommended books for learning marketing</h2>.

This book is written by an author from Google.
It is the latest book so I could learn the best marketing for 2019.
I recommend it because it is easy to understand with many illustrations.
